# Calculator

I have built an user friendly calculator with the help of GUI (graphical user interface) | Java language. 
Packages like util and swing are used , also Action Listeners are set onto the buttons created like minus, plus, division, multiplication, reciprocal, square, square root, delete, Clear, etc.
